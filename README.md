# The Goal

### 1. Create GUI that interprets imputed symbol and output's it's "mathematical" representation
### 2. organise all the possible lock symbols to complexity categories
### 3. generate "gen best symbol" algorithm

As a bonus, and additional challenge whe Window class must be prepared for general use
